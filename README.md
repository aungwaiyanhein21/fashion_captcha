# ml_project

This project is about observing whether the "smart" bot can actually beat simple captcha by classifying images.
I use fashion mnist dataset (https://keras.io/api/datasets/fashion_mnist/). I use all training set for training the model. For the testing set, I leave 100 images alone that will be used in web app for actually competing with human. 

For the web app, it is advisable to use local web server (like xampp) or actual server to run it since there could be issue with accessing files such as json file.
